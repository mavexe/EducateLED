## Introduction

This repository is designed to help beginners and experts alike understand the basics of LED control. Each method is explained in detail, with code snippets and explanations to help you understand how each method works.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `PWM_LED_Control`: Contains examples of LED control using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
- `Interrupt_LED_Control`: Contains examples of LED control using Interrupt-driven methods.
- `Direct_LED_Control`: Contains examples of direct LED control methods.

Each directory contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to use the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/led-control-repository.git

## How 2 start with STM32CubeMX & STM32CubeIDE

> Firstly you need to download the loader from the official

> * STMicroelectronics site (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)

>  * CubeIDE(https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

>  * CubeProgrammer(https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) ***Optional***

>  * Or download it from my repo (en.stm32.../)

After the Download you need to configure the STM32F103CubeMX for your own PCBoard (in my case i have an old STM32F103VET6 with V-kit)
